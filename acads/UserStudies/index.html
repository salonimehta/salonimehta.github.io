        <h1>August 2015 â€“ User Studies <br> Smartphone adoption by low-literate users in India</h1>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>A contextual interview involving 110 users spread across Mumbai (City), Wai (Town), and Menavali (Rural) was conducted by the students of Interaction Design 2015-17 batch in Maharashtra, IN.</p>
        <p>Data collection was performed over a period of two weeks in August 2015. 14 design students visited urban, suburban and rural areas in the states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh in India. The locations were chosen so as to accumulate variety of users ranging from urban to rural areas. Semi-structured interviews were conducted. Each interview lasted for around 30-45 minutes. Interviews were taken in Marathi, Hindi and Telugu language. Out of the total of 110 users, About 48 belonged to urban area and 59 users belonged to rural area. We recruited 89 male and 21 female users. About 19 users were below 25 years of age and about 25 users were above 45 years of age. Education was decided based on the fact that the next billionth customers/users will belong to rural areas within the low-income category. All the users had education level below or equal to 12 years of education. 6 of the users had not undergone any formal education. About 47 participants had 10 to 12 years of education. The professions of the users were - shop owner, rickshaw and truck driver, tailor, cattle owner, homemaker, peon, etcetera.<br>
After the Contextual Inquiries and Analysis the findings were consolidated using Affinity Diagrams as a tool. These yielded level one notes. These notes were then again analysed and classified into level two groupings.<br>

The key findings include observations in purchase decision making patterns, social influences, usage deterrents, comparisons between physical and digital usage, usage of PINs and passwords, E-commerce, Risk assessment and mitigation, the concept of privacy, designated app usage among others.
</p>

<p>The entire study and its findings have been consolidated into three papers, which have been submitted to CHI 2016 conference.<br>
